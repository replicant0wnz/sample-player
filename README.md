# sample-player
## Super simple sample player made to be triggered by an external MIDI event. 
* Triggers note on via a MIDI channel
* Triggers note off via a MIDI channel

This project was created so I could use my MIDI stomp box hooked up to a Raspberry Pi to trigger samples. The *linux-sampler* project could achieve this but it was a bit overkill.
